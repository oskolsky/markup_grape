          <h1>Grape App&nbsp;&mdash; A&nbsp;New-School Technology to&nbsp;Meet Your Old-School Friends</h1>
          <p>Grape App is&nbsp;a&nbsp;free application for iOS (coming soon to&nbsp;Google Play). Grape is&nbsp;an&nbsp;easy way to&nbsp;meet up&nbsp;with friends, hang out, and do&nbsp;things together. Designed to&nbsp;simplify your fast-paced social life, Grape replaces impersonal online communication with a&nbsp;fun way of&nbsp;staying in&nbsp;touch with the friends you want to&nbsp;spend time with.</p>
          <p>Grape App allows you to&nbsp;centralize all of&nbsp;your social activities into one simple app. No&nbsp;more sorting through misplaced emails, invites, texts, voice messages, and chats just to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;good friends together at&nbsp;the same time and the same place. Invite your friends to&nbsp;hang out in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Bunch or&nbsp;join theirs. Those who need to&nbsp;know will know, and those that don&rsquo;t...won&rsquo;t.</p>

          <h1>The Who, What, When, and Where...Right Now</h1>
          <p>How do&nbsp;you usually invite friends to&nbsp;a&nbsp;party? Call each one of&nbsp;them individually? Text? Create an&nbsp;event on&nbsp;the web and wait for a&nbsp;response? Not much of&nbsp;a&nbsp;party when half your fiends get lost on&nbsp;the way, mix up&nbsp;the time, or&nbsp;forget it&rsquo;s even happening.</p>
          <p>Grape simplifies the &laquo;who, what, where, and when&raquo; of&nbsp;hanging out. With a&nbsp;few taps it&rsquo;ll be&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;pick a&nbsp;place, invite the friends you want, map their locations in&nbsp;real time and see an&nbsp;estimate of&nbsp;how long it&rsquo;ll take them to&nbsp;get there. And if&nbsp;there&rsquo;s confusion, the integrated chat feature keeps everyone in&nbsp;the loop.</p>
          <p>Grape is&nbsp;not just for inviting friends&mdash;it&rsquo;s also for joining them. Look at&nbsp;your live feed and decide where you want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;and with whom. Ask to&nbsp;be&nbsp;let into a&nbsp;Bunch and enjoy meeting up&nbsp;with your friends without the stress.</p>

          <h1>Easy, Intuitive, and Just Plain Fun</h1>
          <p>You&rsquo;re busy. Your friends are busy. So&nbsp;get busy with Grape. No&nbsp;more spending twenty minutes just trying to&nbsp;get everyone on&nbsp;the same page for an&nbsp;hour-long lunch.</p>
          <p>Create a&nbsp;Grape profile and then add your friends to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;Bunch. Mix and match your Bunch depending on&nbsp;who you want to&nbsp;hang out with. Plan movies, dinners, parties, clubbing, study groups, poetry readings, concerts, hikes, shopping sprees, basketball games&nbsp;&mdash; anything really. There&rsquo;s no&nbsp;limit. Real time location features, automatic reminders and chat rooms keep you connected so&nbsp;you&rsquo;re always on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;your busy and dynamic social life. Fun emotostickers enhance your chats to&nbsp;make messaging even better.</p>
